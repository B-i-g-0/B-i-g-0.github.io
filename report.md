# Siyabonga Mbendane Lab1

I created a folder where all my work is going to take place and initialized a repository.
I then went to the github website to create a repository there and cloned it  to my local machine on the folder i created initially.
Then connected my local repository and with my remote one on the github site, after that i made sure my main branch is named "main" because sometimes 
you would find it named "master". I then created all the files needed for the assignment and edited them and the staged and committed them.
I then pushed them to my main branch to the repository on github site i created. I then created a new branch and added a file called git.py and put in some code there and staged and commited it. After that i made some changed or updates to the file and the staged and commited it and pushed it to my newly create branch called feature/student-details. I then deployed my index.html file to GitHub Pages.
Checked if all my work was up to date with what was on my local machine and everything was fine, yayy!
Finally wrote this report, saved it, staged and commited the report, lastly pushed my work to github site.

Bundled my repository to single file for submission then submitted.
